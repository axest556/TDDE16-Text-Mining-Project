    "\"This dataset was scraped from http://www.asapsports.com/, using the code in this repository. I designed the webscraping code to account for most of the variance in the website's formatting, but some webpages with formatting that differed significantly were ignored. While manually inspecting random rows of the dataset I did not notice any glaring errors in the transcripts, but I cannot guarantee that there aren't any.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes:\n",
    "- `RowId`: A unique row identifier.\n",
    "- `team1` and `team2`: The two teams in the Stanley Cup Final. Whether a team is team1 or team2 has no meaning: it's determined by the order of their listing on the website.\n",
    "- `date`: The date of the interview.\n",
    "- `name`: The name of the person being interviewed.\n",
    "- `job`: Takes values **\"player\"**, **\"coach\"**, and **\"other\"**. If they are a player or coach at the time of the interview they are assigned accordingly. Otherwise they are assigned \"other\". Most of the people in the \"other\" category are general managers, league officials, and commentators. Some of these values were assigned automatically based on their title in a transcript (e.g. \"Coach Mike Babcock\"), and others were assigned manually. A possible source of error is the fact that I did not manually inspect names that appeared only once.\n",
    "- `text`: The interview transcript. Interviewer questions were not collected, so all of the speech comes from the interviewee. Responses to questions are separated by periods. These periods will be the only punctuation in the text. Note that a likely source of error in this column is a failure to ignore an interviewer's questions.\n",

      " well we're very fortunate to have the players that we do here i look back at when this all started sort of signaled when rocky took over the franchise the changes he made gave us some momentum and excitement we had a good year leading into that year but rocky came onboard and sort of changed the whole mentality of the organization he brought john mcdonough onboard from that point on we kind of felt like we were getting closer and closer obviously the season was when we finally broke through those players were the ones that really made this thing go when you get a group like that together young players that show they can win that's what you need in this day and age i think there's a lot of factors it's not just that joel and his staff have done a tremendous job with these guys it's not easy to get to this point and to keep the group together there's a lot of highs and lows there's some tense moments over the year but when you start the season in september this is the point that you're building towards which is getting to the final it's a battle to get here so i certainly commend the players and coaches for the job they've done to put us in this position we got a lot of work left ahead of us here it's a challenge but you look at what our main guys have done to this point not only in this playoff run but in the other ones i think it shows you they're true champions you can't really single one guy out it's a collection of guys that have been with us for a while they've made it a special thing to be part of stan bowman well from where i see it jonathan is incredibly competitive he hates to lose that's probably a common trait for all athletes nobody wants to lose but he's incredibly competitive he just wills his way to it you watch him in practice he gets mad if things don't go his way he has a high standard for himself he holds himself accountable for that reason he is the thing that makes everything go joel is with him on the bench he can comment on that coach quenneville focus and preparation is as good as i've seen in any player the more important the stage the more important the situation he wants to be out there he wants to be successful he'll find a way to make it successful it's an uncanny ability he has that you don't see in too many players it's will competitive warrior leader he's got all the intangibles that you'd like to see in a hockey player stan bowman obviously when you've had a measure of success you want to continue that that's why we play the game is to win it's not easy to do that when we set out years ago we wanted to be a team that continually had a chance to win the cup that's why you get together that's why we play so every year that's our goal there's a lot of factors that go into it like i said ultimately it's the players they're the ones that get on the ice the job our coaching staff has done has been outstanding to prepare these guys and to make the adjustments we've had a lot of continuity in our organization which i think helps if you look back at the organizations that have been able to sustain success they have stability from the top with rocky and john mcdonough all our staff our scouting staff the development group we have they all play a part in this at the end of the day it's the guys that step on the ice that make the difference but there are so many people that are part of it that's what's helped us get to this point stan bowman you're right there's a lot of talk about that all the time but we've been through this before the way i look at it every team is going to have changes going into next year we're not the only ones there's going to be some new players i think there's a lot of ways to look at that if you look at it from a positive you're going to have some new blood you're going to have some guys that weren't part of this this is a great experience for our players for the guys that are new to our team in the future they're going to want to get to this point themselves so you have that new blood in the system going forward it's a challenge the salary cap it's a system we all play under we've been through it before there's changes to be made to every team and we're no different we certainly have expectations that we want to keep this going the main players are going to be back you have to rely on some young guys to step into bigger roles we're seeing that play itself out here over the season players like saad and teravainen young guys that are going to play bigger roles going forward we have some other young players that are going to get opportunities next year as well i think that's not so much the focus for this right now we do get a lot of questions on that but i think we're pretty excited for the game tomorrow night and we're focused on that we'll take care of the other stuff over the summer stan bowman when patrick went down he was probably the best player in the league that was a bit of a blow there but i think we were able to rally around that some other guys stepped up the players we brought in have all contributed in different ways i think when you make moves you're trying to give yourself depth and options you never just say we're getting this one player he's alone going to make the difference things evolve over time whether it's the player's individual play team play injury happenstance guys can emerge in different roles all three of the players we have have been important in getting to this point you can break it down into the nitty‑gritty but certainly i'm happy that we have the depth that we do for me it's giving joel options he's got a great ability to kind of put the right combinations together and make things work that's what the coaches are so good at stan bowman he's seen this team play quite a bit yeah he lives down here in the wintertime he's got a pretty good handle on it he had a firsthand viewing of this team many times he's given us some of his thoughts but i think at this point obviously you've seen what tampa's done they've had a great run it's impressive what they've been able to do to get to this point we're trying to take all the information we can in and prepare ourselves as best we can but ultimately it's going to come down to how we execute tomorrow night coach quenneville still a relatively young player a young stage i don't know if too many players have accomplished what he's accomplished you'd say the future's very bright for him because he's got a lot of hockey left in him it's pretty remarkable the accomplishments because the next accomplishment or the next moment where he's got to try to win he just seems to always be a part of it it's a unique quality that he has he makes people around him better he makes people around him more competitive the way he finds ways to be successful individually and collectively is what probably makes him go better than any player coach quenneville right off the bat you think of the core group they've been around been through some tough ups and downs losing clint this year was part of that process where we had some tough moments i just think that the team finds a way to rely on one another to get through tough moments tough stages tough situations injuries losses we could go on that's the road of trying to make the playoffs the ups and downs of this team we find a way to get back on track quickly that's kind of what the playoffs are all about the best thing about winning the cup is visiting the road and trying to get the cup it's never going to be smooth or easy the great moments are spectacular the tough moments you can get angry from it you can get motivated from it find a way through it but i think the resiliency of this group is as good as you're ever going to be find it can be complimented to our leadership and the guys that have been here for say seven or eight years. after last year we were close we were trying to add to our group one area we want to try to improve upon is our center ice position michal handzus played a big role for us a couple years he was an important player any time you lose a centerman like that you're trying to find that for your team in talking to brad obviously his desire was to play on a strong team have a chance to get back to the final he ended the year in a tough way losing in the final is difficult the discussions really were centered around what we were looking for and how that role was going to fit well with him he's a consummate professional he's obviously played a lot of his career here he had some great moments he's moved on to be an important player in other organizations you saw the ability that he can bring to the table in terms of experience playing in the middle knew he would be playing some talented players however it worked out so that's how the discussion went i think it didn't take too long to convince him that this is an appealing option coach quenneville brad at the start of the year he was fine early on didn't get a ton of ice time didn't get much of a chance to play with kaner we were working more so on systems‑wise the responsibility of a centerman i think he got better with a little bit more ice time got a chance to play with kaner took off looked like there was a little magic there looked like he got more quickness to his game more puck possession i think he got more comfortable in our system he made good improvements over the course of the season that line gave us a dimension offensively and trust defensively which we were looking for i think he's had a real good second part of the season coming into the playoffs he's been real good for us stan bowman yeah i think that's an important attribute it's possibly the most elusive trait to pin down there are certain players that have the ability when the game is on the line to elevate their play and to come through that's the hardest thing to do i think when you look around the league this year you see how close these games are really a lot of times it comes down to just a couple moments within a game certainly during the season that's the case in the playoffs it gets magnified there's certainly more attention given to every shift every game you notice the players that are able to come through in those pressure moments they're the ones that can really make a big difference i'm not quite sure how to explain it or describe it they just have it fortunately we've got a number of guys that can do that they can raise their game in those critical moments we're fortunate to have them on our side that's for sure stan bowman well i mean for most young players it's a process it takes time it's very difficult to just jump into the nhl and be an impact player i mean i suppose toews and kane did that beyond that i think it takes a little bit of a progression an evolution what we try to do with our young players is not rush them to the point where the expectations are unrealistic we try to give these guys a chance when they do make it into the nhl they've had some time to develop their game to gain some confidence usually in the american league so when they get to us that's what joel and the staff have done such a good job of putting these guys in a position where they can succeed we've got a lot of experienced players that can face those tough matchups tough minutes some of the young players can learn the league learn what it's like to be in the nhl for a year it's not easy the schedule the travel the different buildings you go into i mean you have to experience all that so you sort of get that out of the way then you can play hockey if you're trying to experience all that for the first time and be a primary player on your team that's a lot for a young guy to do so i think our coaches have done a good job of working these guys in and giving them the chance to grow that's what we're hoping to do going forward you need young players to succeed in this day and age but it's hard to throw them into the fire in big roles right away i think fortunately we've got some veteran guys that can absorb those tough minutes and let the young guys sort of work their way in\n"

    "    - IDF: Penalizes words that appear in many documents across the dataset.\n",
    "- Result: A word like \"the\" (high document frequency) gets a very low score close to 0. A specific name like \"Gretzky\" (low document frequency) gets a high score.\n",
